    <p>
        Uomo is a fully responsive, multi-page front-end project for a fictional pharmaceutical webshop. The goal of the project was to accurately translate a provided design into a maintainable and scalable website using modern CSS techniques.

Interactive elements such as product cards, promotional blocks, and navigation controls were carefully implemented to match the original design intent.

        This project was completed as part of the CSS course at

        and showcases my ability to work from professional design files and convert them into clean, responsive front-end code.
