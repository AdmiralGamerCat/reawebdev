    <h1>Uomo Webshop</h1>

    <p>
        This project is a responsive, multi-page webshop created for a fictional pharmaceutical brand called
        <strong>Uomo</strong>. It was developed as the final assignment for a CSS course, with the main goal of
        learning how to accurately translate a provided design into a fully responsive website.
    </p>

    <p>
        The entire layout and visual style are based on an existing
        <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/FVOwEQHZ5ZicBrhSRAlRnv?type=design&mode=design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            Figma design
        </a>,
        focusing on consistent spacing, typography, and responsive behavior across different screen sizes.

        This assignment was completed as part of the CSS course on
        <a href="https://www.codecrashers.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeCrashers</a>,
        and demonstrates my ability to work from real design files, structure CSS efficiently, and build
        layouts that adapt smoothly to different devices.
