    <p>
        MovieViewer is a 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA">single-page application</a> 
        built with modern vanilla JavaScript that consumes 
        <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org">The Movie Database</a> (TMDB) API to browse top-rated movies and view detailed film information.
        <br><br>

        The application uses a centralized state system stored in <code>localStorage</code> to manage navigation, pagination, selected language, and active movie selection. This enables seamless page transitions without page reloads while keeping the UI fully synchronized with application state.
        <br><br>

        API responses are cached in memory per language and page to minimize redundant network requests and significantly improve performance during navigation and language switching.
        <br><br>

        The app features dynamic pagination with previous/next controls and adaptive page ranges, including proper handling of API-imposed limits. A custom internationalization layer updates both UI text and API responses in real time when the language is changed.
        <br><br>

        The project is structured using ES modules, reusable DOM utilities, and a clear separation between rendering logic, state management, and data fetching.

    <h2>Fun fact</h2>
    <p>
        The fetch-response caching was added after a bug caused 50+ API requests on every render, resulting in massive performance issues. Fixing this led to a much faster and more scalable application. (oops)
