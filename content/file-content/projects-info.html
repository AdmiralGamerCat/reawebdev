    <h1>Projects Overview</h1>

    <p>
        This folder acts as a central hub for the projects featured in this portfolio.
        Each project is stored in its own directory, containing a short README with
        background information and a live demo to explore.
    </p>

    <p>
        The projects shown here are a mix of course assignments and personal experiments,
        created to practice real-world workflows such as working from designs,
        structuring code, and building interactive user interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can open individual project folders to learn more about how they were built,
        what the original goals were, and which techniques or technologies were used.
        This overview exists to make navigating the project structure easier and to
        provide a single entry point for everything related to my work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Feel free to explore the projects at your own pace.
