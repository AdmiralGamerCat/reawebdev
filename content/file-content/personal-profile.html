        <h1>Hey, I'm Hidde Aalders!</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a 20 year old web developer from Enkhuizen, living together with my parents, brother, sister and 3 cats.<br><br>

            I love playing video games—especially ones that combine great storytelling with freedom and exploration. Some of my favourites are Minecraft, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Marvel’s Spider-Man. Each of these games has something unique to offer, whether it’s creativity, atmosphere, or an unforgettable narrative.<br><br>

            Outside of gaming, I enjoy watching movies and shows. I’m a big fan of the Iron Man movies, the Spider-Verse films, and series like Prison Break and Gravity Falls. I just really appreciate good characters, world-building, and stories that keep you hooked.<br><br>

            Another hobby that gives me a lot of energy is flying my drone. Seeing the world from above feels completely different, and capturing those moments is incredibly fun. You can even <a href="https://youtu.be/iIloJR1ia3Y?si=9qpK57c-ABlYACr7">check out</a> one of my drone flights!<br><br>

            And of course, a huge part of my time goes into working on side projects—including this website. Creating things from scratch lets me learn, experiment, and improve my skills while building something that feels personal.
