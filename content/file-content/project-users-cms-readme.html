    <h1>Users CMS</h1>

    <p>
        This project is a browser-based user management system built using modern JavaScript.
        It was developed through multiple assignments from the advanced JavaScript course,
        with a strong focus on structuring logic using JavaScript classes.
    </p>

    <p>
        The application allows users to be created, edited, and removed, with support for
        different user roles such as <strong>admin</strong> and <strong>customer</strong>.
        Depending on the selected role, the system dynamically generates a different form,
        ensuring that each user type has its own relevant fields and validation logic.

        This project was created as part of the advanced JavaScript course on
        <a href="https://www.codecrashers.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeCrashers</a>,
        and demonstrates my ability to work with JavaScript classes, manage application state,
        and build dynamic, data-driven interfaces without relying on external frameworks.
