    <h1>Users CMS</h1>

    <p>
        A browser-based user management system built with modern, framework-free JavaScript. The application allows users to be created, edited, and deleted, with support for different user roles such as <strong>admin</strong> and <strong>customer</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The interface dynamically generates and validates forms based on the selected user type, ensuring that each role only exposes relevant fields and logic. User data is rendered in separate tables and updated in real time as changes are made.
